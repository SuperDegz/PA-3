# Problem 1
### Objectives: 
This code offers an overview of the Cars dataset by presenting the first and last five rows of the DataFrame. The goal is to help the user understand the dataset's structure and content.

### Insight:
 This code efficiently retrieves specific columns and rows based on conditions, such as displaying odd-numbered columns for the first five rows and filtering data by car models like 'Mazda RX4' and 'Camaro Z28'

 ### Problems that I Encounter:
 The main Problem that I experience is my code has a lot of error after some debigging I found out that the main problem is that import panda as pd was not running

# Problem 2
### Objectives:
This code gives an overview of the Cars dataset by presenting the DataFrame's first and last five rows. 

### Insight:
This code effectively demonstrates how to filter and extract specific data from a dataset using Pandas. It selects odd-numbered columns from the first five rows, retrieves rows matching specific car models like 'Mazda RX4' and 'Camaro Z28', and extracts particular columns ('cyl' and 'gear') for a subset of models. These techniques showcase efficient data querying and column selection to derive targeted insights from the datase
